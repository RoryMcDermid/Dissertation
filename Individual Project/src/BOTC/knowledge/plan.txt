create a file with all the true information (basically just everyone's roles), this will be the grimore that the spy gets to see

Have player input their name, along with names of other players, then their own attributes (class, alignment, etc), then any theories or connections that they have. 

Use that data to give advice as to how they should proceed

Advice will likely start with just filling chains of logic that are already there (if A then B, if B then C, A is true so B and C are as well)

The work from there (if all but 2 players are confirmed townsfolk, other two are evil, sort of logic)
